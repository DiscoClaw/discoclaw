## 0. When to Use Forge

Forge runs a multi-round draft → audit → revise loop, so it adds real turnaround time (~1–3 minutes for a simple plan, longer for complex ones). Knowing when it pays off prevents unnecessary friction.

### Use forge when

- **The plan is large or the scope is uncertain.** Forge's drafter reads the codebase and identifies the affected files; its auditor catches gaps before implementation starts. This adversarial review is worth the overhead when you'd otherwise guess at scope.
- **You're working in an unfamiliar area of the codebase.** The drafter agent explores the relevant source before writing the plan — it's effectively a free codebase-read pass embedded in planning.
- **You want adversarial review before touching code.** The auditor is explicitly instructed to be skeptical. Catching a design flaw in the plan is much cheaper than catching it mid-phase.
- **The change has non-trivial risks.** Forge's auditor checks for security, correctness, and architectural issues that are easy to miss under time pressure.

### Skip forge when

- **You're iterating quickly on a known change.** If you already know exactly what needs to change and why, `!plan <desc>` + editing the file by hand is faster.
- **The scope is small and well-understood.** A one-file fix with a clear diff doesn't need a multi-round draft loop.
- **You're in a tight feedback loop.** If you're already mid-implementation and need to record a plan for tracking purposes, `!plan <desc>` and filling in the template manually is the right call.

### Cost of editing a plan mid-run

Once `!plan run` has started, the phase runner records a `planContentHash` — a fingerprint of the plan file at generation time. If you edit the plan file while phases are running or between runs, the hash changes and the runner blocks with:

```
Plan file has changed since phases were generated — the existing phases may not match the current plan intent and cannot run safely.

**Fix:** `!plan phases --regenerate <plan-id>`

This regenerates phases from the current plan content. All phase statuses are reset to `pending` — previously completed phases will be re-executed. Git commits from completed phases are preserved on the branch, but the phase tracker loses their `done` status.
```

This is intentional: stale phases may no longer match the plan's intent. The escape hatch is `--regenerate`:

```
!plan phases --regenerate plan-NNN
!plan run plan-NNN
```

Regeneration overwrites the phases file and resets all phase statuses to `pending`. Git commits from already-completed phases are preserved on the branch, but the phase tracker loses their `done` status — the runner will re-execute them. Edit the plan before running whenever possible to avoid this.

## 1. Overview

**`!plan`** manages structured implementation plans — markdown files in `workspace/plans/` that track an idea from draft through approval, phase decomposition, and implementation.

**`!forge`** automates plan creation by orchestrating AI agents in a draft → audit → revise loop, producing a reviewed plan ready for human approval.

**When to use which:**

- `!plan <desc>` — you want to write or fill in the plan yourself
- `!forge <desc>` — you want the system to draft, audit, and refine the plan automatically
- With auto implementation enabled, review-ready plans jump straight into execution; otherwise, use `!plan approve` + `!plan run` to execute.

When `FORGE_AUTO_IMPLEMENT=1` (default) the forge still marches every plan through DRAFT → REVIEW, but any REVIEW that meets the gating criteria (no blocking findings, no `CAP_REACHED`, and the context is clean) immediately transitions to APPROVED and kicks off `!plan run`. Severity warnings continue to surface in the completion message and the audit log, and the channel post notes the auto-approval so the team can trace what happened. If the review isn't pristine — blocking issues, cap errors, stale context, or if you opt out by setting `FORGE_AUTO_IMPLEMENT=0` — the bot falls back to the manual CTA described below.

With `FORGE_AUTO_IMPLEMENT=1`, the review still happens, but any REVIEW that meets the gating criteria (no blocking findings, no `CAP_REACHED`, and a pristine workspace context) now auto-transitions to APPROVED and immediately begins `!plan run`. The completion message still calls out any severity warnings so the channel log records lingering concerns even while implementation runs; if the criteria fail or auto implementation is disabled, the manual CTA described earlier under *Manual implementation (opt-out)* takes over instead.

  At any point (except IMPLEMENTING):
  !plan close ──► CLOSED

  Forge cancellation:
  forge cancel ──► CANCELLED
```

**Status transitions by source:**

| Transition | Trigger | Source file |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| → DRAFT | Plan creation | `plan-commands.ts` (template fill) |
| → DRAFT | Forge error recovery | `forge-commands.ts` (catch block) |
| → REVIEW | Forge normal completion | `forge-commands.ts` (`!lastVerdict.shouldLoop` exit) |
| → REVIEW | Forge cap reached | `forge-commands.ts` (post-loop block) |
| → APPROVED | `!plan approve` | `plan-commands.ts` |
| → CLOSED | `!plan close` | `plan-commands.ts` |
| → CLOSED | All phases complete (auto-close) | `plan-commands.ts` (`closePlanIfComplete`) |
| → CANCELLED | Forge cancellation (`!forge cancel`, 🛑 reaction, `!stop`) | `forge-commands.ts` (AbortSignal raised, interrupts active invocation) |

## 5. Quality Gate

Between the last `implement` phase and the `audit` phase, the phase runner inserts a **quality-gate** phase. This phase is a deterministic shell execution — no AI agent, no prompt — that runs `pnpm build && pnpm test` (or custom commands extracted from the plan's `## Testing` section) and blocks the audit phase if they fail.

The quality gate ensures that code changes compile and pass tests before the audit agent reviews them, preventing wasted audit cycles on broken code. Because it is a pure subprocess call, it is fast, reproducible, and freely retryable.
