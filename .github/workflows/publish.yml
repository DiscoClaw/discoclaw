# IMPORTANT: This workflow must ONLY be triggered by a tag push (push.tags).
# DO NOT call this via workflow_call from another workflow (e.g., release.yml).
#
# Why: npm's Trusted Publisher validates the OIDC subject claim, which encodes
# the exact triggering workflow. When called via workflow_call, the claim
# reflects the *caller* workflow, not publish.yml — npm rejects it and falls
# back to token auth, which fails with ENEEDAUTH. The tag push trigger produces
# the correct claim and is the only path that works.
#
# workflow_dispatch is kept for manual emergency publishes from this workflow directly.
