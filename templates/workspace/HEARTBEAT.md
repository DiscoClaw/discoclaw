# HEARTBEAT.md

# Keep this file empty (or with only comments) to skip heartbeat tasks.

# Add tasks below when you want the agent to check something periodically.

# --- Memory maintenance (uncomment to enable) ---
# - Review daily logs older than 7 days in memory/. Distill anything worth keeping into MEMORY.md, then delete the old daily file.
# - Check MEMORY.md for stale or superseded entries. Remove anything no longer relevant.
# - If MEMORY.md exceeds ~2 KB, prune aggressively — keep only what matters for future sessions.
