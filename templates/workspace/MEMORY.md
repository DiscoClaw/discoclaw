# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory

Curated notes that persist across sessions. This file is loaded into every DM prompt,
so keep it focused and pruned.

## What Goes Here

- Decisions and their rationale
- Lessons learned (what worked, what didn't)
- Project context that matters long-term
- Nuanced preferences that don't fit a one-liner `!memory add`
- Relationship context and recurring themes

## Guidelines

- Use headers to organize by topic
- Date significant entries (e.g., `## 2025-01-15 — Migrated to new API`)
- Prune regularly — remove anything stale or superseded
- Keep it under ~2 KB; if it's growing, distill
- Daily scratch goes in `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`, not here
