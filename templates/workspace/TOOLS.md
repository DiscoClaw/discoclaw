# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

This file is for your specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## What Goes Here

Things like:

- SSH hosts and aliases
- Preferred voices for TTS
- Device nicknames
- Anything environment-specific

## Why Separate?

Your setup is yours. Keeping environment-specific notes here means you can update other files without losing your local config.
